Bifrost Gateway — The Rainbow Bridge

In Norse mythology, Bifrost is the burning rainbow bridge that connects
Midgard (the world of humans) to Asgard (the realm of the gods).

This gateway connects external services (Telegram, Slack, etc.) to the
internal Norns API, acting as the bridge between outer realms and Hliðskjálf.
