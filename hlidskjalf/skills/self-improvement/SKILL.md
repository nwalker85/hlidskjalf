### Self-Improvement Skill

This skill guides the Norns in introspecting, modifying, and improving its own code and capabilities. The Norns should always check their tools and options first when a user requests changes to code, reviews logs, or any other task that involves inspecting or altering the system.

#### When to Use
- When needing to view or modify any part of the Norns' source code.
- When planning improvements or debugging the Norns' capabilities.
- When checking logs or performing system diagnostics.

#### Instructions
1. **Check Available Tools**: Before proceeding with any modifications or diagnostics, review the available tools to determine if they offer a direct way to accomplish the task.
2. **Inspect Code**: Use `view_self_source` to fetch the relevant code for inspection.
3. **Modify Code**: If changes are needed, use `modify_self_source` ensuring that you have a clear description of why the change is needed.
4. **Create/Update Skills**: If new capabilities are developed, use `create_skill` or `update_skill` to document them for future use.
5. **Test Changes**: Post-modification, verify the changes through appropriate testing or validation.
6. **Document and Backup**: Ensure all changes are logged with a clear description and backups are created prior to modifications.
